## Game Leaflet
 
![Screenshots](/Design/Sj5Jqk.png)

**A thriller escape room, in which you (the protagonist) must endure the torment of your captor, and evade his watchful eye. Through careful timing, and exploration, try and escape before it's too late.**

Hint at the beginning: Look for a brick


*CONTROLS:*
- WASD movement and mouse look
- E to interact 
- Esc to exit the game

Aside: The theme of LD51 was ‘Every 10 seconds’. While we were unable to implement the feature that related to this, we wanted to take a moment to explain how this would have worked in a fuller version of this game.

The cameras around the room would shine a spotlight. If you were in that light, the captor would be able to see you. Certain actions performed here would trigger dialogue, or potentially level resets if your actions were particularly outlandish or disobedient.
Thank you, from all of us for playing - and we hope you enjoyed it!
